# final-project-template
This is a template repository for the final project

Python version used is 3.12

- List of major dependencies,
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
requests
json
os
bs4
sqlite3

To run my code run the get_data.py file followed by clean_data.py file and then the analyze_data.py file and visualize_results.py file

get_data.py generates api_football.json, matches.csv, shooting.csv, team_data.csv and LiverpoolPlayerStats.db. This is the raw data.
clean_data.py generates df_clean.csv, matches_clean.csv, shooting_clean.csv, team_clean.csv, Liverpool2022.csv and Liverpool2024.csv.

All files would be generated in the same src folder where the python files are located.
The files currently organized in data folder are all the raw and processed data files that exist just for demonstration of the data used by me.
